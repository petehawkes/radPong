# radPong

A radial pong prototype. The final game was built in g-speakâ„¢ for a gestural kiosk on display at Oblong Industries' booth at Mobile World Congress 2012 in Barcelona. 

The paddle arc diminishes in size and ball speed increases slightly after each hit. New ball direction isn't completely random, but chooses a new angle relative to the last and narrowed by speed. Bonus padding is added when the paddle is in motion to allow for gratifying last second, diving saves late game.
